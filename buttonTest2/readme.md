#  WTH is going on

so if you run the project with line 36, buttonBlank1.toggle() commented out, you see what I want to see: the title of the button cycles between "", "S", and "O"

But as soon as you uncomment that line, it all goes to shit, and I have no idea why. any line modifying buttonBlank1 causes the button behavior in the grid to be bad, and I cannot for the life of me tell why. I just want that top button to be disabled when the title of the button i am clicking on is ""

why is this hard?
